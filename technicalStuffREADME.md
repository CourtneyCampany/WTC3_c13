# WTC3_c13
Techincal stuff: run by Court first (Craig?)

TDL functioning 

-	The TDL files gives 20 second averages. Do we have the raw data or sd for that period of measurements?
-	What is the flush time in between lines?
-	What is the frequency of the data logger for raw data (10 Hz, 1 s)?
-	Did you filter raw data from the TDL outside 2SD?
-	Do you have an Allan variance or stability test for the instrument?

TDL cal 
(In our lab we use the TDL just for collection of raw data and we do the calibration ourselves so I'd be more comfortable if we knew:)
-	What is the CO2 concentration and d13C of the two reference bottles?
-	How did you calibrate the data? Did you interpolate the value of the reference cylinders over time in between the start and end of each measurement cycle?

On the WTC flux

-	For each chamber we need a number for either CO2 concentration inside the chamber or air flow.
- It appears that the flux number might be easier to get.
- In Barton et al. 2010 AFM, there is an equation for correcting flow out of each WTC with transpiration flow, but I've looked a the flow in and out from and they look very close. For now I assume flow in and out are the same.
- There is a problem with flow into WTC number 4 on the March measurement campaing. The CO2 cocentration values also look a bit wierd.
